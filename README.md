# Mocked

Have an interview coming up but can't find a partner to practice with?

Use our Mock Interview App to simulate real interviews as many times as you
want!

## How to use

After creating an account and signing in, the app will automatically generate
three random questions for you to solve in your mock interview.

After completing a question, click the 'Go to next section' button to receive
your next question.

When you are finished, you can reset and start over if you'd like!

Happy practicing!
